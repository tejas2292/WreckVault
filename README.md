WreckVault is a modern, self-hosted password manager built for those who want **total control** over their data. Unlike cloud providers, your secrets never leave your device unencrypted. We use a **Zero-Knowledge Architecture** where the server only stores encrypted blobs; the decryption key (your Master Password) exists *only* in your browser's memory.

## ✨ Features

- **🔐 Zero-Knowledge Encryption**: AES-256 encryption happens on the client. The server *never* sees your passwords.
- **🐳 Dockerized**: Deploys in seconds with a single `docker-compose up` command.
- **🎨 Sleek UI**: A beautiful, dark-themed interface built with React and Vanilla CSS.
- **⚡ Real-time**: Fast, responsive interactions powered by a Node.js/Express backend.
- **🕸️ Open Source**: No hidden code. Audit the security yourself.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your machine.

### Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```

2.  **Ignite the Engine** 🏎️
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3.  **Access the Vault**
    Open your browser and navigate to:
    👉 **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

## 🛠️ Security Model

1.  **User enters Master Password.**
2.  **Key Derivation**: Browser derives a cryptographic key.
3.  **Operation**:
    - **Read**: Browser requests encrypted data -> Decrypts locally.
    - **Write**: Browser encrypts data -> Sends only the ciphertext to server.
4.  **Result**: If the database is compromised, the attacker only sees garbage text.
